<span class="w3-tag">A security program review and overview with examples.</span><br><br>
<p>
Overview:<br><br>TL;DR - All security efforts from an organization are justified by the Organizational security plan.<br><br><u>Section Hierarchy:</u><br> ./Introduction and why should I care? # <- You are here<br>./The components of an organizational security project<br>./Organizational roles and responsibilities<br>./The plotting of a security project<br>./Considerations and best practices for writing <br>./Examples<br><br>At the core of any organization exists risk, or the possibility for harm to occur. Risk derives from how likely a vulnerable component of an organization is to result in organizational damage. When a vulnerability meets a threat, or a trigger event that results in the incurred cost of risk, the company is impeded on its journey to satisfy it's business objectives. If an organization incurs enough threat cost, an organization can fail to continue operations.<br><br>The risk an organization faces will generally increase with business expansion. This inherent risk growth is the reasoning for why organizations enforce security programs. A security program is a persistent project tasked with ensuring long-term business operations by mitigating risk to a business down to an acceptable level. As with all security efforts, a security project is a success when two requirements become met: reduced cost of operations via risk mitigation and improved operational efficiency.<br><br>In this write-up, I'm going to focus on the core components of typical security projects and their purpose for existence in regards to their organization. I will use real world organizational documents to demonstrate what these documents look like which may assist instill this knowledge deeper in memory.<br><br>As with everything I suggest on this website, CISSP candidates (such as myself) should not learn security project material to pass the CISSP exam, but instead should learn this material for their future role and it's associated responsibilities. We should see obstacles as opportunities. Further, I recommend coming up with a method of infusing these learnings into daily routine. Try to identify policy topics in your daily operations to become more aware of policy agreements:<br>Do you agree to any banners or login messages when using your work computers?<br>Do you use any form of access management? (physical controls, logical controls, etc.?)<br>Do you print organizational documents?<br><br><br>
